Tests on the Jaco arm (overall)
============
Date: 22/01/2015

Location: RWTH HÃ¶rn, Aachen

Tester: Mathijs de Langen (langen@robot-rose.nl)

Introduction
------------

These tests show the usability of the current state of the following software components:
* [wpi_jaco](https://github.com/RIVeR-Lab/wpi_jaco/)
* [rose_moveit_controller](https://github.com/RobotRose/rose_moveit_controller), this package is an interface for MoveIt! created by Debjyoti
* [rose_arm_controller](https:://github.com/RobotRose/rose_arm_controller) for the Jaco/Mico arm. It uses wpi_jaco for the arm control and rose_moveit_controller (for path planning).

Still needs to be tested:
* [ros-jaco](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/jaco-ros), has not been tested yet since there is no MoveIt! integration. 

Test setup
----------
The test setup at Aachen consists of a Jaco arm mounted on top of a table. The control will be directly done via the command line.
* actionlibs axclient (rosrun actionlib axclient.pysrun), or;
* publishers (via rostopic pub), or; 
* servicecalls (rosservice).
